<p>General Terms and Conditions</p>
<ol class="numbers">
<li><strong>General Terms and Conditions.</strong>
<ol class="numbers">
<li><strong>These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) Govern our Solution.</strong> WHEN YOU SIGN AN ORDER FORM WITH US, OR CONTINUE TO USE OUR SOLUTION AFTER THE &#8220;LAST UPDATED&#8221; DATE OF THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING TO THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF YOUR ORGANIZATION. These Terms refer to River Digitals as “us,” “we,” or “our” and to your business organization as “you” or “your”. For purposes of these Terms, we refer to the sale of a license to digital product(s) and the sale of a service use right to services as a “sale” of a “product,” even though digital product(s) and services are licensed and not sold.</li>
<li><strong>The River Digitals Goal.</strong> Our goal at the River Digitals family of companies (including River Digitals, Inc., River Digitals Ireland Limited, River Digitals GmbH and/or DR globalTech, Inc.) is to help you simplify and expand your ecommerce sales on a global basis. We do this by optimizing your trading pattern without your need to invest in the local infrastructures required to manage the complex and ever-changing landscape of local regulations and taxes. You control your shopper experiences, and our solution helps you increase your global sales and comply with applicable laws.</li>
<li><strong>Our Solution; Appointment of River Digitals as Reseller.</strong> River Digitals’s core product is a fully-integrated suite of back-end services – payments, tax, fraud and compliance – called Global Seller Services (“<strong>GSS</strong>”) that is delivered through our proprietary technology. GSS incorporates and is enabled by our business model, where we act as an online reseller of your products. GSS is bundled with other technological capabilities to offer a product suite designed to facilitate your use of GSS (collectively, the “<strong>Solution</strong>”), as applicable to your industry segment or vertical. When you use our Solution to sell your products, you appoint River Digitals, and River Digitals accepts the appointment, to resell and distribute your products to shoppers.</li>
<li><strong>Applicable Terms.</strong> Use of the Solution is governed by these Terms, the Standards listed below, and mutually approved Order Form(s) that identifies pricing and specifics for the Solution you order (collectively, the “<strong>Agreement</strong>”). The Order Form is the only portion of the Agreement you will sign.Standards for the Solution:
<ul class="numbers">
<li>Service Level Agreement</li>
<li>Data Handling Standards</li>
<li>Guidelines &amp; Best Practices &#8211; Our proprietary guidelines to ecommerce which describe the legal framework(s), Application Programming Interface(s) (“<strong>APIs</strong>”) and implementation guidance necessary to conduct online commerce in compliance with local regulations using our Solution. These may not be accessed without a non-disclosure agreement between us.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Your Business and Shopper Experience.</strong> As between you and us, you are fully responsible for all aspects of your business and shopper experiences, including: (i) your website and online shopping experience; (ii) your online order capture experience (to the extent we are not directly providing the capture experience for you); (iii) your products and services (and the use or misuse of your products and services), any warranties or recalls related to your products and services, and any infringement issues; (iv) shopper relations, including support service for any installation, use, configuration and operation of your products and services; (v) your systems or the systems you procure from third parties, including any downtime, errors or fraud on such systems; (vi) your personnel; and (vii) your compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to your responsibilities, including without limitation those relating to consumer protection, privacy, import or export compliance, money laundering, and data security. In order to connect to and use the Solution you must implement and maintain your ecommerce shopper experience in accordance with the Agreement and APIs for the Solution and territories listed in your Order Form so that your shopper/transaction data follows the rules required to transact business related to the Solution in the applicable territory. If, from time to time, there are material changes to the Agreement and/or APIs as they apply to the Solution (for example, due to changes in local laws or regulations), we will notify you in advance where governmental and regulatory communication timelines permit and you must comply with those changes to continue using the Solution.</li>
<li><strong>Information You Provide.</strong> Our Solution is dependent upon the information you provide to us (e.g., we must know about your products in order for our Solution to legitimately resell your products, process payments for your products, calculate any taxes due, and for our software logic to help determine if a purchase is fraudulent), so you must provide to us in a timely manner all information in your control reasonably required by us to comply with our obligations. You must respond promptly to any request for direction, information, or approval that are reasonably necessary for us to deliver the Solution for you or protect our rights under the Agreement. The information you provide must be accurate, true and complete, and if any information is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete, you must immediately notify us, and we may require you to obtain additional risk and/or compliance approval from us and we, as a condition to such approval, may require additional obligations from you. In order to verify your information and compliance with the Agreement and as may be required of us by the card associations, processor/acquiring banks or legal or regulatory payment authorities in connection with our resale of your products through the Solution, we may require you to verify your information or to permit a third party auditor approved by us to conduct an audit of your information, and you must fully cooperate with any reasonable requests for information or assistance by us or the auditor. We may share the reports with the card associations, processor/acquiring banks or legal or regulatory payment authorities used to provide the Solution to you as they require of us.</li>
<li><strong>Fees.</strong> You agree to pay our fees and reimbursable expenses for the Solution you order in accordance with applicable Order Form and as calculated under these Terms.</li>
<li><strong>Licenses.</strong> During the term of your use of the Solution, (i) we grant you a license to use our APIs and/or administration interface applicable to the Solution solely for your use of the Solution, and (ii) if the Solution requires either of us to use the other party’s trademarks and logos to perform or use the Solution, we each hereby grant the other party a license to do so solely as required in connection with the performance or use of the Solution under the Agreement, and only in the form and with appropriate legends as required by the other party. With your express written permission, we may also include your company name and logo in our marketing materials.</li>
<li><strong>Ownership and Intellectual Property.</strong> As between you and us, you own all of your Confidential Information and materials you provide to us, whether electronic or physical, in the course of performing your obligations under these Terms (including without limitation your products, trademarks and logos, as may be applicable) and all proprietary and intellectual property rights thereto. As between us and you, we own the Solution, its constituent parts, our software, marks, logos, work product, information prepared by, provided by, or used by us (other than the materials you provide to us), and any modifications or improvements to them, and all proprietary and intellectual property rights thereto.</li>
<li><strong>Confidentiality and Protection of Personal Data.</strong> We and you each agree, as it relates to our or your respective handling of confidential information, to maintain in strict confidence and to use only to deliver or use the Solution or as otherwise authorized by the other party, all information received under the Agreement which is of a confidential nature concerning the other party&#8217;s business operations, technical and financial information, employees, suppliers, providers or shoppers (&#8220;<strong>Confidential Information</strong>&#8220;). Information will not be deemed Confidential Information if it is or becomes generally available to the public without breach of the Agreement or is independently developed by the non-disclosing party or its personnel or representatives without reliance in any way on Confidential Information of the disclosing party.In connection with our performance, tracking and improvement of the Solution we may disclose Confidential Information to our third-party providers (such as our corporate affiliates, merchant/acquiring banks and contractors) and we will remain liable for any breach by them of this confidentiality provision. You may disclose Confidential Information to your third-party providers who are subject to a written confidentiality obligation no less restrictive than this provision only to the extent necessary for your use of the Solution, and you will remain liable for any breach by them of this confidentiality provision. You or we may disclose Confidential Information required to be disclosed by law or court order so long as the disclosing party provides prompt written notice to the other party (if not prohibited by law), tries to limit the disclosure to the minimum amount required and obtains confidential treatment or a protective order, and, if requested, cooperates with the other party to do so. We may also use and disclose anonymized and/or aggregated information relating to usage of the Solution that does not identify you or any particular shopper or supplier (such as aggregated conversion data to help optimize future sales conversion rates and fraud data to continually improve our anti-fraud logic for future transactions), and we may disclose information stored in our Solution if we believe it is required to do so by law or to reduce risk of credit or other kind of fraud.<br />
‌We and you each agree, as applicable, to comply with all applicable data protection and data privacy laws, rules, and regulations as they relate to our or your respective handling, control of and/or processing of personal data (or similar defined terms under applicable laws) as set forth in the Data Handling Standards. We agree to be liable for any breach of this paragraph by our subcontractors or agents, if any are involved in performing the Solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‌We are committed to maintaining Service Organization Controls (SOC 1 and SOC 2) for financial and security controls.</li>
<li><strong>Change in Circumstances.</strong> If you are subject to a material change in circumstances (including without limitation a change in ownership, a material change in your financial condition, a material change in your products or services, or a change in the laws or regulations applicable to your business) that we believe, in good faith, is likely to cause you or us to be in violation of an applicable law, rule or regulation or which represents a significant economic or liability risk to us, we may immediately, on notice to you, (i) require you to establish and maintain a deposit account with us in an amount we in good faith specify, which may be funded by deductions from payments due to you from us, or by charging your account with us, or a deposit by you; (ii) institute a delay in our periodic payments to you; (iii) suspend or limit your use of the Solution; or (iv) terminate this Agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Term.</strong> The Agreement governs your use of the Solution until for as long as you use the Solution. The term for each Solution is defined in the Order Form and will automatically renew for one (1) year periods unless either party provides written notice of termination to the other at least ninety (90) days in advance of the end of the then-current term.</li>

A party shall provide the other party with certificates of insurance upon request.</li>
<li><strong>Our “Know Your Customer” and Anti Money Laundering Regulatory Obligations.</strong> When we enter into an Order Form with you, we will be taking on online sales related risks on your behalf by acting as your online reseller, processing regulatory requirements, taxes and payments for you and delivering the Solution for you.

As part of our diligence, we may engage in any investigation of your finances, activities, and operations that we reasonably deem necessary to confirm your eligibility for and use of the Solution, and you agree to provide us with any information required to complete such investigation. You authorize us to share any information we collect or receive from or about you with the card associations, processor/acquiring banks or legal or regulatory payment authorities. We will also conduct, and you authorize us to conduct, a customary commercial background check for these purposes and to assess the risk of our doing business with you.

Subject to your termination rights in Section 1.13.2, your continued use of the Solution after the effective date of any modification to the Solution or the Agreement constitutes your acceptance of such modification.</li>
<li><strong>Electronic Documents.</strong> We provide our documents electronically rather than in paper form. We will notify you that a document is available with a link to that document. At any time and without giving advance notice, we may elect not to send a document electronically, in which case a paper copy of the document will be sent to you at your corporate address on file.</li>
<li><strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> These Terms, the applicable Standards, including the Guidelines and Best Practices, and the relevant mutually approved Order Form(s) constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and in the applicable Order Form(s), and supersede any previous and contemporaneous agreements and understandings with respect to the subject matter hereof.

Neither party has the right, power or authority to act or create any obligation on behalf of the other party. We may engage the services of subcontractors or agents to assist us in the performance of our obligations. Because a subcontractor (such as a payment provider) or agent may perform the same function for many or all clients, and we require flexibility to switch or alternate subcontractors and agents to ensure service level standards, pricing commitments or other obligations under this Agreement, we are unable to inform individual clients or seek approval from individual clients each time there is a change or reassignment of a subcontractor or agent; however we will be responsible for the acts and omissions of our subcontractors and agents in the performance of such obligations under the Agreement.</li>

You may be required to agree to additional appendices and/or agreements with us and/or our third-party financial institutions, processors, or card associations that contain terms and obligations specific to certain solutions under our Global Seller Services. We do not warrant that a third-party financial institution, processor or payment services provider will enter into a relationship with you to provide any portion of the GSS. Any third-party financial institution, processor or payment services provider is an independent third party and we are not liable for any actions or inactions of third parties, included but not limited to, a third party’s unwillingness to work with you.</li>
<li><strong>Assignment.</strong> Neither party may assign the Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party except in connection with a merger or sale of all or substantially all of its assets or equity, but in such event the assigning party must provide prompt written notice to the non-assigning party of the change and the non-assigning party may terminate the Agreement if the assignment is to a direct competitor of the non-assigning party. The Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.</li>
<li><strong>No Third-Party Beneficiaries.</strong> The Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto (including our corporate affiliates) and does not create any third-party beneficiaries, whether intended or incidental.</li>

If our European entities but not our U.S. entities are parties to the Agreement as defined in the Order Form, disputes related to the Agreement are governed by the laws of England and Wales, without regard to any conflict of law provisions, and the parties expressly agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in London, England for such disputes. The parties specifically disclaim application (i) of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods, 1980, and (ii) of Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code as codified. The prevailing party in any action to interpret or enforce the Agreement will be entitled to its reasonable attorneys’ fees as well as all other remedies available to it.</li>
<li><strong>Injunctive Relief.</strong> A party may seek injunctive relief for any breach of the Agreement, without the necessity of posting a bond in connection therewith. The availability of injunctive relief will be a cumulative, and not an exclusive, remedy available to the parties.</li>
<li><strong>Enforceability.</strong> If any provision of the Agreement is found to be legally unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible and any such unenforceability will not prevent enforcement of any other provision of the Agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Time to Dispute.</strong> Any claim by us or you for breach of the Agreement must be brought within two (2) years of the date the party first learns of the breach or else the claim will be forever barred.</li>
<li><strong>Force Majeure.</strong> No party will be in breach of the Agreement if it is unable to perform its obligations (other than payment obligations) due to conditions beyond its reasonable control, but if the condition remains in effect for more than thirty (30) calendar days (or if the condition causes, or a party believes in good faith it is likely to cause, a violation of applicable law, rule or regulation or a significant economic or liability risk), either party may terminate the Agreement without cause upon written notice to the other party.</li>

We will treat any non-fraudulent payment reversal and any transaction identified as fraudulent or potentially fraudulent after settlement of payment but prior to receipt of a payment reversal for such transaction, as a refund validly provided by us, if we remain entitled to the charge for handling the payment reversal. Further, any sale where the fulfillment of that product was initiated pursuant to a valid payment authorization but is subsequently rejected or cancelled prior to settlement by us, the merchant bank or payment processor, will not be treated as a completed sale to a shopper by us for the purposes of calculating payments due to you.</li>

<li>EXPORT &amp; CUSTOMS DUTIES
<ol class="numbers">
<li>Each Product and DR Service and any related items (including software, technology and technical information) sold, exported, transferred, supplied or licensed by us may be subject to and governed by the laws of the United States and other countries, including but not limited to the US Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and US Foreign Assets Control Regulations (FACR). You are required to comply with all applicable laws relating to the export, re-export, transfer, use, or import of any Product or related items. Diversion contrary to applicable law is prohibited. Notwithstanding any other request or agreement to the contrary, neither you nor DR shall take or be required to take any action prohibited or penalized under US or applicable foreign law.</li>
<li>The tangible shipment of Products from one country for delivery in another country may be subject to customs duties, fees, taxes and/or other charges in the country of ultimate destination. Unless otherwise expressly stated by DR during the order process, (a) your payment for the order in question does not include any customs duties, fees, taxes and/or other charges that may be due and payable in the Product’s country of ultimate destination, and (b) the receiving party in the Product’s country of ultimate destination is responsible for making entry and properly declaring the merchandise to the appropriate customs authorities, paying any applicable customs duties/fees/taxes/charges, and/or satisfying any additional import-related requirements. You should contact the local customs authorities in the relevant jurisdiction for further information on the applicable customs requirements and procedures, duties, fees, taxes, and/or other charges that may be assessed against the Product.</li>
<li>When you are making a Purchase, you may be given an option to prepay or not prepay import tariffs and customs duties that may be levied by the destination country, and any disbursement fees, advancement fees or similar fees that may be imposed by the shipper, broker, the customs authority of the destination country or other party (collectively, &#8220;Import Costs&#8221;). We will make commercially reasonable efforts to estimate the amount of Import Costs (said estimate, the &#8220;Estimate&#8221;). However, the Estimate may be more or less than the final actual amount of Import Costs due and payable. We have no control over the Import Costs and cannot always predict with 100% accuracy what the final actual amounts may be. For greater certainty, you should contact your local customs office for further information on the import tariffs and customs duties that may be applicable to your Purchase.
<ol class="numbers">
<li>If you choose to prepay the Import Costs, you agree and acknowledge that (a) the actual Import Costs may be more or less than the Estimate and (b) you will NOT be asked to pay more money OR receive any refund in the case that the actual Import Costs differ from the Estimate.</li>
<li>If you choose to prepay the Import Costs contained in the Estimate, you agree and acknowledge that the receiving party in the Product’s country of ultimate destination remains ultimately responsible for making entry and properly declaring the merchandise to the appropriate customs authorities, paying any applicable customs duties/fees/taxes/charges, and/or satisfying any additional import-related requirements. You should contact the local customs authorities in the relevant jurisdiction for further information on the applicable customs requirements and procedures, duties, fees, taxes, and/or other charges that may be assessed against the Product.</li>
<li>If you choose to not prepay the Import Costs, you agree and acknowledge that (i) the actual Import Costs may be more or less than the Estimate; (ii) you (and not River Digitals, the broker, the shipper, the supplier or any other party) must bear the responsibility of paying all actual Import Costs; (iii) in the case that any entity other than you must pay some or all of the actual Import Costs on your behalf to effect customs clearance, you will reimburse (upon request) that entity in full for the actual Import Costs paid on your behalf; and (iv) failure by you to pay Import Costs in a timely manner may not only cause delays beyond our original delivery estimates, but also may put you at risk of potential liability for tariffs and other fees.</li>

<li><strong>AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE</strong>
<ol class="numbers">
<li>We will make every reasonable effort to resolve any disagreements that you have with us. In the event that we cannot resolve a disagreement to your satisfaction (or if we cannot informally resolve a concern we may have with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and we agree that except as expressly provided in Section 10.2 below, any claim, dispute, or controversy you may have against us arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with these Terms, the DR Commerce Solution, or the purchase or attempt to purchase of any Products or DR Services through the DR Commerce Solution shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by the AAA, including the AAA&#8217;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this agreement to arbitrate in this Section 10 (“Rules and Procedures”). The AAA&#8217;s rules, and a form for initiating arbitration proceedings, are available on the AAA&#8217;s site at http://www.adr.org. The language of any dispute resolution procedure or any proceedings will be English.</li>
<li>This Section 10 applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law. The disputes governed by these procedures in this Section 10 include without limitation (a) claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us; (b) claims that arose out of your use of the DR Commerce Solution; and (c) claims currently the subject of a purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class. However, the dispute resolution procedure specifically does not apply to (i) a claim relating to the enforcement or validity of your or our intellectual property rights; (ii) a claim relating to an allegation of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use; or (iii) claims for which class action litigation can be brought.</li>
<li><strong>YOU AND WE BOTH AGREE THAT (A) EACH OF US CAN ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND THERE SHALL BE NO AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS; (B) ARBITRATION CAN DECIDE ONLY YOUR AND/OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY&#8217;S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S); AND (C) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.</strong></li>
<li>If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, either you or we may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and us (subject to the arbitrator&#8217;s discretion to require an in-person hearing based on the circumstances). Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or us, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. Any in-person arbitration shall be held at a location determined by the AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and us.</li>
<li>You agree further that: (a) the arbitrator shall apply Minnesota law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, including principles of equity, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (b) the arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving us, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving both you and us to the extent required by applicable law; (c) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.</li>
<li>With the exception of Section 10.3 above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by the AAA, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, Section 10.3 above is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor we shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.</li>

</li>
<li><strong>GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE </strong>Any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Minnesota, without regard to or application of its choice of law rules or conflicts-of-laws principles, except that the Arbitration provision of these Terms shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event that the Agreement to Arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and us must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Hennepin County, Minnesota, and both you and us agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Hennepin County, Minnesota for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.</li>

You may not assign or transfer your rights under these Terms, and any purported assignment or transfer shall be void. No relaxation, forbearance, delay or indulgence by either you or us in enforcing any of these Terms or the granting of time by either party to the other shall prejudice or restrict such rights and powers. No waiver of any term or condition of these Terms shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by us. The waiver of any breach of any Term shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or condition. If for any reason we determine or a court of competent jurisdiction finds that any provision or portion of these Terms to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid under applicable law in a particular jurisdiction: (a) these Terms will not be affected in other jurisdictions to the extent that such determination or finding has no application; and (b) in the relevant jurisdiction, the remainder of these Terms (to the fullest extent permitted by law) will continue in full force and effect.

<ol class="numbers">
<li><strong>General Terms and Conditions.</strong>
<ol class="numbers">
<li><strong>These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) Govern our Solution.</strong> WHEN YOU SIGN AN ORDER FORM WITH US OR CONTINUE TO USE OUR SOLUTION AFTER THE &#8220;LAST UDPATED&#8221; DATE OF THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING TO THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF YOUR ORGANIZATION. These Terms refer to River Digitals as “us,” “we,” or “our” and to your business organization as “you” or “your”. For purposes of these Terms, we refer to the sale of a license to digital product(s) and the sale of a service use right to services as a “sale” of a “product,” even though digital product(s) and services are licensed and not sold.</li>
<li><strong>The River Digitals Goal.</strong>  Our goal at the River Digitals family of companies (including River Digitals, Inc., River Digitals Ireland Limited, River Digitals GmbH and/or DR globalTech, Inc.) is to help you simplify and expand your ecommerce sales on a global basis. We do this by optimizing your trading pattern without your need to invest in the local infrastructures required to manage the complex and ever-changing landscape of local regulations and taxes. You control your shopper experiences, and our solution helps you increase your global sales and comply with applicable laws.</li>
<li><strong>Our Solution; Appointment of River Digitals as Reseller. </strong> River Digitals’s core product is a fully-integrated suite of back-end services – payments, tax, fraud and compliance – called Global Seller Services (“<strong>GSS</strong>”) that is delivered through our proprietary technology. GSS incorporates and is enabled by our business model, where we act as an online reseller of your products. GSS is bundled with other technological capabilities to offer a product suite designed to facilitate your use of GSS (<strong>collectively, the “Solution”</strong>), as applicable to your industry segment or vertical. When you use our Solution to sell your products, you appoint River Digitals, and River Digitals accepts the appointment, to resell and distribute your products to shoppers.</li>
<li><strong>Applicable Terms.</strong> Use of the Solution is governed by these Terms, the Standards listed below, and mutually approved Order Form(s) that identifies pricing and specifics for the Solution you order (<strong>collectively, the “Agreement”</strong>). The Order Form is the only portion of the Agreement you will sign.
<ul>
<li>Standards for the Solution:
<ul>
<li>Service Level Agreement</li>
<li>Data Handling Standards</li>
<li>Guidelines &amp; Best Practices &#8211; Our proprietary guidelines to ecommerce which describe the legal framework(s), Application Programming Interface(s) (“<strong>APIs</strong>”) and implementation guidance necessary to conduct online commerce in compliance with local regulations using our Solution. These may not be accessed without a non-disclosure agreement between us.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Your Business and Shopper Experience. </strong> As between you and us, you are fully responsible for all aspects of your business and shopper experiences, including: (i) your website and online shopping experience; (ii) your online order capture experience (to the extent we are not directly providing the capture experience for you); (iii) your products and services (and the use or misuse of your products and services), any warranties or recalls related to your products and services, and any infringement issues; (iv) shopper relations, including support service for any installation, use, configuration and operation of your products and services; (v) your systems or the systems you procure from third parties, including any downtime, errors or fraud on such systems; (vi) your personnel; and (vii) your compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to your responsibilities, including without limitation those relating to consumer protection, privacy, import or export compliance, money laundering, and data security. In order to connect to and use the Solution you must implement and maintain your ecommerce shopper experience in accordance with the Agreement and APIs for the Solution and territories listed in your Order Form so that your shopper/transaction data follows the rules required to transact business related to the Solution in the applicable territory. If, from time to time, there are material changes to the Agreement and/or APIs as they apply to the Solution (for example, due to changes in local laws or regulations), we will notify you in advance where governmental and regulatory communication timelines permit and you must comply with those changes to continue using the Solution.</li>
<li><strong>Information You Provide.</strong> Our Solution is dependent upon the information you provide to us (e.g., we must know about your products in order for our Solution to legitimately resell your products, process payments for your products, calculate any taxes due, and for our software logic to help determine if a purchase is fraudulent), so you must provide to us in a timely manner all information in your control reasonably required by us to comply with our obligations. You must respond promptly to any request for direction, information, or approval that are reasonably necessary for us to deliver the Solution for you or protect our rights under the Agreement. The information you provide must be accurate, true and complete, and if any information is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete, you must immediately notify us, and we may require you to obtain additional risk and/or compliance approval from us and we, as a condition to such approval, may require additional obligations from you. In order to verify your information and compliance with the Agreement and as may be required of us by the card associations, processor/acquiring banks or legal or regulatory payment authorities in connection with our resale of your products through the Solution, we may require you to verify your information or to permit a third party auditor approved by us to conduct an audit of your information, and you must fully cooperate with any reasonable requests for information or assistance by us or the auditor. We may share the reports with the card associations, processor/acquiring banks or legal or regulatory payment authorities used to provide the Solution to you as they require of us.</li>
<li><strong>Fees. </strong> You agree to pay our fees and reimbursable expenses for the Solution you order in accordance with applicable Order Form and as calculated under these Terms.</li>
<li><strong>Licenses.</strong>  During the term of your use of the Solution, (i) we grant you a license to use our APIs and/or administration interface applicable to the Solution solely for your use of the Solution, and (ii) if the Solution requires either of us to use the other party’s trademarks and logos to perform or use the Solution, we each hereby grant the other party a license to do so solely as required in connection with the performance or use of the Solution under the Agreement, and only in the form and with appropriate legends as required by the other party. With your express written permission, we may also include your company name and logo in our marketing materials.</li>
<li><strong>Ownership and Intellectual Property. </strong> As between you and us, you own all of your Confidential Information and materials you provide to us, whether electronic or physical, in the course of performing your obligations under these Terms (including without limitation your products, trademarks and logos, as may be applicable) and all proprietary and intellectual property rights thereto. As between us and you, we own the Solution, its constituent parts, our software, marks, logos, work product, information prepared by, provided by, or used by us (other than the materials you provide to us), and any modifications or improvements to them, and all proprietary and intellectual property rights thereto.</li>
<li><strong>Confidentiality and Protection of Personal Data.</strong>  We and you each agree, as it relates to our or your respective handling of confidential information, to maintain in strict confidence and to use only to deliver or use the Solution or as otherwise authorized by the other party, all information received under the Agreement which is of a confidential nature concerning the other party&#8217;s business operations, technical and financial information, employees, suppliers, providers or shoppers (&#8220;<strong>Confidential Information</strong>&#8220;). Information will not be deemed Confidential Information if it is or becomes generally available to the public without breach of the Agreement or is independently developed by the non-disclosing party or its personnel or representatives without reliance in any way on Confidential Information of the disclosing party.<br />
‌<br />
In connection with our performance, tracking and improvement of the Solution we may disclose Confidential Information to our third-party providers (such as our corporate affiliates, merchant/acquiring banks and contractors) and we will remain liable for any breach by them of this confidentiality provision. You may disclose Confidential Information to your third-party providers who are subject to a written confidentiality obligation no less restrictive than this provision only to the extent necessary for your use of the Solution, and you will remain liable for any breach by them of this confidentiality provision. You or we may disclose Confidential Information required to be disclosed by law or court order so long as the disclosing party provides prompt written notice to the other party (if not prohibited by law), tries to limit the disclosure to the minimum amount required and obtains confidential treatment or a protective order, and, if requested, cooperates with the other party to do so. We may also use and disclose anonymized and/or aggregated information relating to usage of the Solution that does not identify you or any particular shopper or supplier (such as aggregated conversion data to help optimize future sales conversion rates and fraud data to continually improve our anti-fraud logic for future transactions), and we may disclose information stored in our Solution if we believe it is required to do so by law or to reduce risk of credit or other kind of fraud.<br />
‌We and you each agree, as applicable, to comply with all applicable data protection and data privacy laws, rules, and regulations as they relate to our or your respective handling, control of and/or processing of personal data (or similar defined terms under applicable laws) as set forth in the Data Handling Standards.<br />

<li><strong>Termination.</strong>
<ol class="numbers">

<li>Following any notice of termination or non-renewal, we may create a deposit from remaining payments due to you in an amount we reasonably estimate to cover potential liabilities associated with providing the services set forth in this Agreement that may occur following the effective date of termination (<strong>the “Wind-down Deposit”</strong>). After termination of this Agreement, we will release portions of the Wind-down Deposit in monthly steps, as determined in our sole discretion, to account for the decrease in risk exposure until the full Wind-down Deposit is released, no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days following the termination of this Agreement.</li>

<li><strong>Modifications. </strong> From time to time in the course of our business we may modify the Agreement and/or the Solution (for example, to remain in compliance with changing laws, rules, regulations and market conditions around the world, or as required by the card associations or our third-party providers).

Subject to your termination rights in Section 1.13.2, your continued use of the Solution after the effective date of any modification to the Solution or the Agreement constitutes your acceptance of such modification.</li>
<li><strong>Electronic Documents.</strong> We provide our documents electronically rather than in paper form. We will notify you that a document is available with a link to that document. At any time and without giving advance notice, we may elect not to send a document electronically, in which case a paper copy of the document will be sent to you at your corporate address on file.</li>
<li><strong>Miscellaneous. </strong> These Terms, the applicable Standards, including the Guidelines and Best Practices, and the relevant mutually approved Order Form(s) constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and in the applicable Order Form(s), and supersede any previous and contemporaneous agreements and understandings with respect to the subject matter hereof. No provisions in your purchase orders or your other business forms will alter the Agreement. Amendments may only be made by a written agreement in an Order Form executed by authorized officers of both parties and by us in accordance with Section 1.16. If there is any conflict between the provisions in the Agreement and any mutually approved Order Form between the parties, the mutually approved Order Form will control.</li>

<li><strong>Independent Contractors.</strong> The parties are independent contractors, and not partners or joint venturers. Neither party has the right, power, or authority to act or create any obligation on behalf of the other party. We may engage the services of subcontractors or agents to assist us in the performance of our obligations. Because a subcontractor (such as a payment provider) or agent may perform the same function for many or all clients, and we require flexibility to switch or alternate subcontractors and agents to ensure service level standards, pricing commitments or other obligations under this Agreement, we are unable to inform individual clients or seek approval from individual clients each time there is a change or reassignment of a subcontractor or agent; however we will be responsible for the acts and omissions of our subcontractors and agents in the performance of such obligations under the Agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Third Party Requirements.</strong> These Terms are designed for the Solution to coordinate with the requirements of our third-party providers and comply with applicable legal regulations around the world, so they are not modifiable on an individual client basis. You may be required to agree to additional appendices and/or agreements with us and/or our third party financial institutions, processors, or card associations that contain terms and obligations specific to certain solutions under our Global Seller Services. We do not warrant that a third-party financial institution, processor or payment services provider will enter into a relationship with you to provide any portion of the GSS. Any third-party financial institution, processor or payment services provider is an independent third party and we are not liable for any actions or inactions of third parties, included but not limited to, a third party’s unwillingness to work with you.</li>
<li><strong>Assignment.</strong> Neither party may assign the Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party except in connection with a merger or sale of all or substantially all of its assets or equity, but in such event the assigning party must provide prompt written notice to the non-assigning party of the change and the non-assigning party may terminate the Agreement if the assignment is to a direct competitor of the non-assigning party. The Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.</li>
<li><strong>No Third-Party Beneficiaries.</strong> The Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto (including our corporate affiliates) and does not create any third-party beneficiaries, whether intended or incidental.</li>
<li><strong>Waiver.</strong> No waiver of any provision or breach of the Agreement will be effective unless made in writing, nor will it be construed to be a continuing waiver of such provision or breach.</li>
<li><strong>Choice of Law &amp; Venue.</strong> If our U.S. entities are parties to the Agreement as defined in the Order Form, disputes related to the Agreement are governed by the laws of the State of New York, USA, without regard to any conflict of law provisions, and the parties expressly agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Hennepin County, Minnesota, USA for such disputes. If our European entities but not our U.S. entities are parties to the Agreement as defined in the Order Form, disputes related to the Agreement are governed by the laws of England and Wales, without regard to any conflict of law provisions, and the parties expressly agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in London, England for such disputes. The parties specifically disclaim application (i) of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods, 1980, and (ii) of Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code as codified. The prevailing party in any action to interpret or enforce the Agreement will be entitled to its reasonable attorneys’ fees as well as all other remedies available to it.</li>
<li><strong>Injunctive Relief.</strong> A party may seek injunctive relief for any breach of the Agreement, without the necessity of posting a bond in connection therewith. The availability of injunctive relief will be a cumulative, and not an exclusive, remedy available to the parties.</li>
<li><strong>Enforceability.</strong> If any provision of the Agreement is found to be legally unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible and any such unenforceability will not prevent enforcement of any other provision of the Agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Time to Dispute.</strong> Any claim by us or you for breach of the Agreement must be brought within two (2) years of the date the party first learns of the breach or else the claim will be forever barred.</li>
<li><strong>Force Majeure.</strong> No party will be in breach of the Agreement if it is unable to perform its obligations (other than payment obligations) due to conditions beyond its reasonable control, but if the condition remains in effect for more than thirty (30) calendar days (or if the condition causes, or a party believes in good faith it is likely to cause, a violation of applicable law, rule or regulation or a significant economic or liability risk), either party may terminate the Agreement without cause upon written notice to the other party.</li>

We will treat any non-fraudulent payment reversal and any transaction identified as fraudulent or potentially fraudulent after settlement of payment but prior to receipt of a payment reversal for such transaction, as a refund validly provided by us, if we remain entitled to the charge for handling the payment reversal. Further, any sale where the fulfillment of that product was initiated pursuant to a valid payment authorization but is subsequently rejected or cancelled prior to settlement by us, the merchant bank or payment processor, will not be treated as a completed sale to a shopper by us for the purposes of calculating payments due to you.</li>

<p>These Standards apply to the Solutions and are in addition to the terms in the Agreement. Capitalized terms used in these Standards have the same meaning as they do in the Agreement. These Standards are dependent upon your compliance with the best practices for your integration and platform usage, as defined in the Guidelines and Best Practices for the Solution you select, and upon your compliance with your responsibilities as defined in these Standards.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service Levels</span></p>
<ol class="numbers">
<li>Uptime. The Solution under the Agreement is available at least 99.9% of the time measured over each calendar Quarter (January 1, April 1, July 1, October 1). Availability is calculated separately by platform in accordance with the following formula: Availability formula<br />
<code><strong>Availability</strong> = total minutes per quarter - total minutes unavailable per quarter<br />
(Total minutes per Quarter)</code></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limitation</span>: This availability commitment only applies if your usage is less than:
<ol type="A">
<li>1,000,000 milliseconds of compute time per five (5)-minute interval; and</li>
<li>6,000,000,000 milliseconds of compute time per month.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unavailability.</span> A “<strong>service interruption</strong>” is any time exceeding five (5) consecutive minutes where our Order Takers (a) do not respond to any valid shopper request, or (b) provide only HTTP response codes 500, 502, 503, or 504 responses to all valid shopper requests, or (c) some combination of (a) and (b).“<strong>Order Taker</strong>” is defined as those systems within our checkout flow which respond to web requests.A period of “<strong>unavailability</strong>” (i) commences as of the earlier of the time we detect an incidence of a service interruption or the time that you notify us of the service interruption, and (ii) ends when our Order Takers commence providing routine responses to your shopper requests again. Unavailability shall be monitored by us.Unavailability shall not include any interruption arising from:
<ol type="A">
<li>scheduled maintenance and/or upgrades, including any redundant environments,</li>
<li>your failure to follow the Guidelines and Best Practices,</li>
<li>our suspension or termination of your right to use the Solution in accordance with the Agreement, or</li>
<li>any event beyond our control, which includes without limitation any external interruption of power or telecommunications; denial of service, virus/worm or other attack; the failure or substantial failure of the Internet; the internet service provider or internal telecommunications equipment experienced by you or any of your customers; the browser configurations, hardware and/or software of you or any shopper; and/or any other force majeure event (including without limitation acts of God, terrorism, natural disaster, war, riots, and labor strife).</li>
</ol>
<p>We use all reasonable efforts to avoid having to take any redundant environments offline for executing schedule maintenance. Should under exceptional circumstances such maintenance nevertheless prove necessary, we will provide as much notice as practically possible and plan such maintenance in a manner and on a date and time to minimize the potential number of affected potential transactions.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shared Responsibility to Mitigate Risk.</span> Security and compliance are a shared responsibility between us and you.We are responsible for taking reasonable precautions to mitigate the risk of unavailability, including but not limited to (a) use of anti-virus and anti-trojan software; (b) installation of available hardware and software patches; (c) implementation of industry standard security measures, such as firewall-based network segmentation, intrusion detection, and anti-dedicated denial of service (“anti-DDOS”) measures; (d) implementation of business continuity and disaster recovery measures, such as application redundancy and scheduled backups; and (e) maintaining redundant infrastructure providers.You are responsible for taking reasonable precautions to mitigate the risk of unavailability of the Solution to you, including but not limited to: (i) implementing proper input filtering, (ii) applying intrusion detection and web application firewall (WAF) practices, (iii) applying anti-DDOS measures, (iv) jointly investigating and resolving security and compliance issues as they impact both you and us from time to time, and (v) properly interpreting HTTP response code 429 from the Solution and waiting the directed amount of time before retrying the intended request.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery.</span> We maintain a business continuity and disaster recovery plan designed to minimize the impact to our operations of a man-made or natural disaster or other similar events which could impact our business operations and/or technology infrastructure. We annually test our ability to comply with our business continuity and disaster recovery plan and will make our results available upon request.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Issue Resolution.</span> We target resolution of issues, based on their severity. In the event an issue could be classified within more than one Severity Level, we shall initially classify the issue; in addition, we may, upon notice to you, reclassify the priority level of an issue as fixes are rendered and/or developed or the severity of the issue decreases. In the event you disagree with our classification or reclassification, as appropriate, you may contact us to discuss when a further reclassification of the issue is appropriate.

<p>For the purposes of this table, the “Acknowledgment” is the time from when we first learn of a problem to when we initially contact to you by email or telephone acknowledging such reported issue; and “Issue Resolution” is when we substantially resolve the issue or begin a plan to resolve the issue, whichever occurs first.</li>
<li>Remedies. If we fail to meet our availability commitment in any calendar quarter during which we were compensated for your use of the Solution, your sole and exclusive remedy is a service level credit as follows, subject to your rights in case of a continuous failure as described in section 8 below. The service level credit is calculated by applying the service credit percentage to the charges we earned and received less the cost of payment processing for transactions we processed during that calendar quarter for your use of the Solution. We will apply any service credits only against future Solution charges otherwise due from you. Service credits will not entitle you to any refund or other payment from us. Subject to section 8 below, the foregoing is your sole and exclusive remedy for our breach.

<ol type="A">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remedy Procedure.</span> To receive a service credit, you must submit a claim by opening a case with our Customer Success Team. To be eligible, we must receive your credit request within 30 days’ after the end of the calendar quarter in which the service level commitment was not met and must include:
<ol type="i">
<li>the words “SLA Credit Request – Solution” in the subject line;</li>
<li>the dates and times of each period of unavailability that you are claiming;</li>
<li>the calendar quarter with respect to which you are claiming service credits;</li>
<li>Your request logs that document the errors and corroborate your claimed outage (any confidential or sensitive information in the logs should be removed or replaced with asterisks).</li>
</ol>
<p>If we confirm the Quarterly Uptime Percentage is less than our service commitment, then we will issue you a service credit within one billing cycle following the quarter in which we confirm your request. If you don&#8217;t provide your request and other information needed above, you will be disqualified from receiving a service credit.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alternative Remedy in Case of Continuous Failure.</span> Should we fail to meet our availability commitment in any two (2) consecutive calendar quarters during which we were compensated for your use of the Solution, you shall, as an alternative remedy, be entitled to terminate the Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to us. For the avoidance of doubts, in case you decide to terminate the Agreement based on this provision you shall not be entitled to receive additional service credits for the calendar quarter giving rise to such termination right.In the event you fail to provide us with notice of such termination within forty-five (45) calendar days of the end of the calendar quarter giving rise to such termination right, you shall be deemed to have waived its right to terminate the Agreement for such failure (but shall have the right to so terminate if the condition is met in any subsequent two (2) calendar quarters).</li>

<p>These Standards are in addition to the terms in the Agreement. Words used in these Standards without a definition but with an initial capital letter have the same meaning (i) as found in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as of 25 May 2018 and any binding orders thereof issued by relevant authorities; (ii) as defined in Section 13, “Definitions”, included at the end of these Standards; or (iii) as found in the Agreement. Where a term in these Standards conflicts with a corresponding term in the Agreement, the term in these Standards will control with respect to the parties’ obligations under these Standards.</p>
<ol class="numbers">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background and Purpose.</span> We hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards of conduct in our daily activities, including our data handling practices. As such, these Standards were created to allow us to have an open data sharing arrangement with you, while ensuring that any transfers of data between the parties are handled appropriately under Data Protection Legislation. Here, we have laid out the ground rules for which data will be shared, including listing our respective responsibilities under Data Protection Legislation.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Obligations of the Parties.</span> We understand fully our obligations under Data Protection Legislation and we need to ensure that data is shared according to such laws. As such, we need to confirm that the parties will make every effort to process the Personal Data correctly under Data Protection Legislation. Additionally, because under GDPR only data controllers collect personal data from data subjects (and are also independently responsible for determining the legal bases under which they obtain and process the data), both us and you maintain the responsibility of being our own (Independent) Data Controllers for Personal Data and our respective processing activities.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description of Personal Data and Purpose of Processing.</span> Each party will process Personal Data of those purchasers that purchase a title, license right, and/or usage right to a product using our Service (“Shopper”). Those categories of Personal Data may include names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, and other related order information.The Personal Data will be processed independently by each party for the following purposes:
<ul>
<li>To provide the Shoppers with the services they have requested, in accordance with the relevant party’s privacy policy,</li>
<li>To ensure the performance of the parties’ obligations under the Agreement,</li>
<li>To provide other similar services to Shoppers where the Shoppers have, if applicable, consented to such services, and as decided by each party as its own (Independent) Data Controller, and</li>
<li>To share the data with third parties and use Processors to process the data so long as the parties comply with Data Protection Legislation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Provided to Shoppers.</span> The parties agree to include the applicable link to each party’s privacy policy, prior to the collection, by such party, of the Shopper’s Personal Data, so that it is clear to the Shopper which privacy policy applies to the processing of their data. For the avoidance of doubt, your privacy policy will govern how you will process Personal Data; and, ours will govern how we will process Personal Data. We are each responsible for fulfilling our promises as outlined in our respective privacy policies.Where applicable, you will gather and document the applicable consents from Shoppers for the processing of their data, such as for marketing activities. And, where there is another lawful basis for the processing (such as “Legitimate Interests”) you will also document the applicable lawful basis and our reasoning behind such decision(s).</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Handling Requests; Notifying the Other party.</span> Data Protection Legislation such as GDPR (as defined in Section 13, “Definitions”) grants Shoppers certain rights regarding their personal data that a Data Controller holds and obligates Data Controllers to facilitate the exercise of those rights. As such, each party is responsible for facilitating the exercise of Shoppers’ rights under applicable law, and must send any applicable data handling requests to the other party without undue delay.Such rights may include the right to consent, and to withdraw the consent, right of access, right to rectification, restriction of Processing, erasure, data portability, to object to Processing, and the right not to be subject to automated individual decision making. It is up to each party to ensure the Shoppers’ rights are honored as appropriate, considering applicable legal requirements. It is also each party’s responsibility to ensure that the Shopper has been appropriately authenticated under Data Protection Legislation prior to acting on any access request.Specifically as it relates to data erasure requests from an Shopper, we request that you log into our administration interface software (or successor user interface) and click on the “Request removal of Personal Information” button, which will automatically trigger a notification to us. You may also send any communications related to such data handling requests to the River Digitals contact point(s) noted in the Order Form under “Privacy”.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Security of Personal Data.</span> Both parties agree to take reasonable steps to provide a level of security appropriate to the sensitivity of the Personal Data in each party’s control.
<ul>
<li>Both parties represent, warrant and covenant to the other party that (i) it has implemented technical and organizational security measures, which meet industry standards and comply with all applicable Data Protection Legislation, to prevent any unauthorized access, use or disclosure of Personal Data, and (ii) its processing of Personal Data will at all times be performed in accordance with such technical and organizational security measures; and</li>
<li>To the extent required by applicable law, the parties will not transfer the Personal Data to a processor, vendor, service provider, subcontractor or sub-processor (a “Processor”), unless (i) it has first concluded a written agreement with the Processor that imposes obligations and restrictions on the third-party at least as restrictive as those that apply to the other party under these Standards (“Processing Agreements”), and (ii) such transfer complies with applicable Data Protection Legislation; and</li>
<li>The party who has transferred Personal Data to the Processor shall be liable for the acts or omissions of that Processor with respect to Personal Data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Security Breach.</span> With respect to any Security Breach, the parties will take all steps reasonably necessary to (i) investigate and remediate the effects of such occurrence, (ii) mitigate any harm to those Shoppers that are affected or could be affected by such occurrence, (iii) prevent the re-occurrence, and (iv) comply with applicable Data Protection Legislation.Each party shall notify the other party in writing or by phone (for River Digitals, the phone number is 952-253-1234, attention: Legal) after becoming aware of any compromise of the Personal Data that may affect the other party. The responsible party shall also notify the Supervisory Authority and Shoppers, where required and within the applicable time-period, under Data Protection Legislation. As such, the parties will coordinate with, consult with and keep the other party regularly informed related to its response to any Security Breach.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Transfers of Personal Data Outside of the EEA.</span> A party shall not transfer Personal Data (nor permit any Personal Data to be transferred) to a territory outside of the EEA unless it has taken such measures as are necessary to ensure the transfer is in compliance with applicable law. The parties acknowledge that adequate protection for the Personal Data must exist for any transfer and will, if needed, enter into an appropriate written agreement governing such transfer of Personal Data, including, but not limited to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, unless another adequacy mechanism for the transfer exists, including without limitation Privacy Shield for transfers to the United States of America.To the extent that the parties’ transfer of Personal Data is reliant on the Standard Contractual Clauses for Controller to Controller transfers, the Standard Contractual Clauses including its Annex B shall form part of the Agreement. As such, the parties agree that the Standard Contractual Clauses using the Annex B which is attached at the end of these Standards, plus the Privacy details in the Order Form, shall constitute the completed Standard Contractual Clauses. Where and to the extent the Standard Contractual Clauses apply pursuant to this section, if there is any conflict between these Standards and the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Liabilities, Indemnification.</span> Each party agrees to be held solely liable for the performance of its obligations under Data Protection Legislation and these Standards, and any fines imposed by a Supervisory Authority (or its equivalent) for that party’s failure to comply with Data Protection Legislation or these Standards shall be paid by that party that failed to comply.While nothing in the Agreement shall be construed as making the parties, acting as (Independent) Data Controller, involved in the same processing, should, pursuant to Article 82(4) of the GDPR, a party be found to be liable for the entire damage arising from a breach or breaches of the GDPR relating to activities under these Standards, in order to ensure effective compensation of one or more individuals, then that party shall indemnify the other party for that portion of the compensation attributable to any breaches of the GDPR for which it is responsible.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requests from Supervisory Authorities.</span> The parties agree to cooperate with each other when they receive a request from a Supervisory Authority or court of law that impacts the other party. Where one party receives the request (the “Receiving Party”), the Receiving Party shall communicate the request to the other party promptly, and where possible, prior to responding to the Supervisory Authority or court of law. However, if this is not possible due to the immediacy of the request, the Receiving Party shall communicate the request to the other party as soon as reasonably possible after submission of the response.</li>
<li><strong>Survival of these Standards.</strong> Regardless of whether the Agreement is terminated or expires, if either party has access to, processes or otherwise retains Personal Data, the parties agree to comply with all applicable requirements under Data Protection Legislation. Therefore, the applicable sections of these Standards that relate to the parties’ obligations under Data Protection Legislation, survives any termination or expiration of the Agreement. To the extent there are no further obligations of the parties under Data Protection Legislation, these Standards will terminate. Also, and for the avoidance of doubt, each party is responsible for destroying the Personal Data in accordance with applicable laws and neither party is required to return to the other party the Personal Data that is in their possession.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Applicable Law and Dispute Resolution.</span> These Standards (including the Agreement) constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and these Standards supersede all prior agreements or representations, oral or written, regarding such subject matter. These Standards are governed by the law governing the Agreement, except for where the applicable Standard Contractual Clauses are executed between the parties, which contain specific provisions on the applicable law in Clause IV, “Law applicable to the clauses.”</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definitions.</span> The following definitions apply to these Standards:
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Legitimate Interests</span> means that processing is permitted if it is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the controller (or by a third party), except where the controller’s interests are overridden by the interests, fundamental rights or freedoms of the affected Shoppers which require protection.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</span> is that regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, which was enforceable as of 25 May 2018.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Protection Legislation</span> means any applicable data protection, security, consumer protection and related regulatory and legal obligations, the GDPR (defined above), the California Consumer Protection Act and any binding orders issued by relevant bodies.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Standard Contractual Clauses</span> are the contractual requirements approved by the European Commission from time to time for the transfer of Personal Data from EU Controllers to non-EU or EEA Controllers.</li>

<li>An order submitted by you only constitutes an offer by you to us to purchase Products or DR Services subject to these Terms at the price and on the terms stated in the order, and is subject to our subsequent Acceptance (as defined below), irrespective of whether the button or link you press or activate to submit your order to us includes words such as “complete order” or otherwise indicates that it is the final step in completion of your order. Any order confirmation email received by you prior to our Acceptance shall constitute an acknowledgment of our receipt of your offer only, and not an acceptance of your offer.</li>
<li>You acknowledge and agree that if you are placing an order through a website, by clicking or activating the button or hyperlink to submit your order, you are placing a legally binding offer. You consent to: (i) the use of electronic communications in order to enter into contracts and place orders<br />
with us; and (ii) the electronic delivery of notices, policies and records of transactions initiated or completed by you online.

<li>We may keep records of orders received, accouterments, acceptances and other contract records after Acceptance for a period not to exceed the maximum period permitted by law. We may be able to provide you with copies on written request; however you must make sure you print a copy of all such documents and these Terms for your own records.</li>
<li>If we have cause to believe that you are unable to pay your debts as they fall due, you fail to pay any amount by the due date or breach any of these Terms, we believe you have engaged in fraud or criminal activity in connection with your use of the DR Commerce Solution, or we are unable to process payment to the payment method you provided with your offer, then, without prejudice to any of our other rights, we may do any or all of the following: (a) stop any Products in transit to you; (b) suspend further deliveries of Product if on an ongoing basis; (c) stop or suspend provision of DR Services; (d) cancel or revoke issues Service Use Rights for Third Party Services; (e) cancel any automatic renewal plan in which you have elected to participate; and/or (f) cancel any and all other contracts between us and you.</li>

<li><strong>PRICING AND PAYMENT TERMS</strong>
<ol class="numbers">
<li>Prices do not include shipping and handling, expedited service, or sales taxes, if applicable, which will be added to your total price. You are responsible for any shipping and handling charges and state and local sales or use taxes that may apply to your order. If the price of a Product is obviously incorrect, regardless of whether it is an error in a price posted on the DR Commerce Solution or otherwise communicated to you, then we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to cancel your order and refund to you the amount that you paid, regardless of how the error occurred.</li>
<li>Prices payable for Products or DR Services are those in effect at the time of Acceptance, unless otherwise expressly agreed. Prices may be indicated on the DR Commerce Solution or an order acknowledgment but the authoritative price in the event of any discrepancy, is the price that is notified to you on our Acceptance through the charge placed through your selected payment method. Payment shall be made by the payment method selected during your order completion process through the DR Commerce Solution. We will charge credit or debit cards on dispatch of the Product or commencement of DR Services. We reserve the right to verify and/or authorize credit or debit card payments prior to Acceptance.</li>
<li>Except as expressly provided elsewhere in these Terms or the DR Commerce Solution, payment may be taken in full notwithstanding any claim for short delivery or defects.</li>
<li>Where the payment is invoiced, each invoice shall be due and payable in full by the due date specified on the invoice, and if no date is specified on the invoice, within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice. If you fail to pay invoiced amount when due, we may (a) by notice declare all invoiced amounts unpaid at that date to be immediately due and payable, and (b) take all actions determined necessary and appropriate by us to collect such unpaid amount.</li>
<li>No counterclaim or set-off may be deducted from any payment due without our written consent. We may also take action against you for the price of Products at any time after payment has become due even though title or rights to those Products may not yet have passed to you.</li>
<li>If you elect to use the services of a third party payment or billing provider in connection with your purchase from us, your use of such services will be subject to the third party provider’s own terms and conditions. You may be required to create an account with such third party provider and/or provide that third party provider with your bank account or credit/debit card details. We are not responsible for, and you agree to hold us harmless from and against any liability resulting from, the acts or omissions of any third party payment or billing provider.</li>
<li>Any extension of credit allowed to you may be changed or withdrawn at any time. Interest shall be chargeable on overdue amounts accruing on a daily basis at the maximum amount permitted under applicable law from the due date for payment until our receipt of the full amount (whether before or after judgment). You shall indemnify us on demand against any out of pocket expenses incurred in relation to recovery of any overdue amounts.</li>
</ol>

We reserve the right to charge you for any extra costs arising from changes you make to the Delivery Address after you submit an order.</li>

<p>However, your rights of repair or replacement of any Products or any part or parts thereof which are found to be defective will (except where agreed otherwise) be negated or rendered void where Products have been repaired or altered by persons other than the manufacturer, us or any authorized dealer; defective Product or Products have not been returned together with full details in writing of the alleged defects within 30 days from the date on which such Products were delivered; and/or defects are due (wholly or partially) to mistreatment, improper use or storage or maintenance or installation, or failure to observe any manufacturers&#8217; instructions or other directions issued or made available by us in connection with the delivered Products.</li>
<li>You will have the benefit of any manufacturer&#8217;s, licensor&#8217;s or supplier&#8217;s warranty provided by the manufacturer, licensor or supplier to you in connection with your purchased Products and should refer to the relevant documentation supplied with the Product in this regard. (If applicable, the Returns Policy may also set out procedures applicable to repairs or replacement of defective Products delivered.)</li>

In addition:
<ol class="numbers">

<li><strong>WE HAVE PRICED PRODUCTS AND DR SERVICES AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE FROM US UPON THE UNDERSTANDING, AND YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THE UNDERSTANDING, THAT TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE LIMITED REMEDIES PROVIDED HEREIN FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE: (a) OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY) SHALL IN NO CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE APPLICABLE PRODUCTS AND/OR DR SERVICES WHICH GIVE RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY; AND (b) NEITHER WE NOR OUR SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY DESCRIPTION (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS) IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THIS SITE OR YOUR PURCHASE OR USE OF ANY PRODUCT OR DR SERVICE, HOWEVER CAUSED AND WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, TORT, WARRANTY, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE AWARE OR ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES, AND IRRESPECTIVE OF THE NUMBER OR NATURE OF CLAIMS.</strong></li>
<li><strong>NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LIABILITY TO THE EXTENT SUCH LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED AS A MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW.</strong></li>
<li>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless us, our subsidiaries and affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against all claims and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to (a) any Products purchased by you in connection with your use of the DR Commerce Solution (including without limitation your use of any Third Party Service for which you purchase Service Use Rights from us), or (b) the violation of Section 8 of these Terms by you, your employees, consultants, agents, distributors, or customers.</li>
<li>To the fullest extent permitted by law and save where expressly set out in any License Terms or elsewhere, we shall have no liability to you in the event of the Products or DR Services infringing or being alleged to infringe the proprietary rights of any third party. In the event that the Products are or may be the subject of patent, copyright, database right, registered design, trade mark or other rights of any third party, you should refer to the relevant terms of the Product manufacturer and/or licensor/owner. We shall be obliged to transfer to you only such right or title as we have.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>EXPORT &amp; CUSTOMS DUTIES
<ol class="numbers">
<li>Each Product and DR Service and any related items (including software, technology and technical information) sold, exported, transferred, supplied or licensed by us may be subject to and governed by the laws of the United States and other countries, including but not limited to the US Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and US Foreign Assets Control Regulations (FACR). You are required to comply with all applicable laws relating to the export, re-export, transfer, use, or import of any Product or related items. Diversion contrary to applicable law is prohibited. Notwithstanding any other request or agreement to the contrary, neither you nor DR shall take or be required to take any action prohibited or penalized under US or applicable foreign law.</li>
<li>The tangible shipment of Products from one country for delivery in another country may be subject to customs duties, fees, taxes and/or other charges in the country of ultimate destination. Unless otherwise expressly stated by DR during the order process, (a) your payment for the order in question does not include any customs duties, fees, taxes and/or other charges that may be due and payable in the Product’s country of ultimate destination, and (b) the receiving party in the Product’s country of ultimate destination is responsible for making entry and properly declaring the merchandise to the appropriate customs authorities, paying any applicable customs duties/fees/taxes/charges, and/or satisfying any additional import-related requirements. You should contact the local customs authorities in the relevant jurisdiction for further information on the applicable customs requirements and procedures, duties, fees, taxes, and/or other charges that may be assessed against the Product.</li>
<li>When you are making a Purchase, you may be given an option to prepay or not prepay import tariffs and customs duties that may be levied by the destination country, and any disbursement fees, advancement fees or similar fees that may be imposed by the shipper, broker, the customs authority of the destination country or other party (collectively, &#8220;Import Costs&#8221;). We will make commercially reasonable efforts to estimate the amount of Import Costs (said estimate, the &#8220;Estimate&#8221;). However, the Estimate may be more or less than the final actual amount of Import Costs due and payable. We have no control over the Import Costs and cannot always predict with 100% accuracy what the final actual amounts may be. For greater certainty, you should contact your local customs office for further information on the import tariffs and customs duties that may be applicable to your Purchase.
<ol class="numbers">
<li>If you choose to prepay the Import Costs, you agree and acknowledge that (a) the actual Import Costs may be more or less than the Estimate and (b) you will NOT be asked to pay more money OR receive any refund in the case that the actual Import Costs differ from the Estimate.</li>
<li>If you choose to prepay the Import Costs contained in the Estimate, you agree and acknowledge that the receiving party in the Product’s country of ultimate destination remains ultimately responsible for making entry and properly declaring the merchandise to the appropriate customs authorities, paying any applicable customs duties/fees/taxes/charges, and/or satisfying any additional import-related requirements. You should contact the local customs authorities in the relevant jurisdiction for further information on the applicable customs requirements and procedures, duties, fees, taxes, and/or other charges that may be assessed against the Product.</li>
<li>If you choose to not prepay the Import Costs, you agree and acknowledge that (i) the actual Import Costs may be more or less than the Estimate; (ii) you (and not River Digitals, the broker, the shipper, the supplier or any other party) must bear the responsibility of paying all actual Import Costs; (iii) in the case that any entity other than you must pay some or all of the actual Import Costs on your behalf to effect customs clearance, you will reimburse (upon request) that entity in full for the actual Import Costs paid on your behalf; and (iv) failure by you to pay Import Costs in a timely manner may not only cause delays beyond our original delivery estimates, but also may put you at risk of potential liability for tariffs and other fees.</li>

<li>NOTICES
<ol class="numbers">
<li>Any notice or other communications in relation to these Terms may be given by sending the same by hand delivery, pre-paid post, fax or e-mail (a) with respect to notices and communications to you, to the address and contact information you provided in connection with your purchase of Products and/or DR Services; and (b) with respect to notices and communications to us, to the address listed at the beginning of these Terms or as otherwise specified in your order confirmation email or notification of Acceptance.

<li><strong>AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE</strong>
<ol class="numbers">
<li>We will make every reasonable effort to resolve any disagreements that you have with us. In the event that we cannot resolve a disagreement to your satisfaction (or if we cannot informally resolve a concern we may have with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and we agree that except as expressly provided in Section 10.2 below, any claim, dispute, or controversy you may have against us arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with these Terms, the DR Commerce Solution, or the purchase or attempt to purchase of any Products or DR Services through the DR Commerce Solution shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by the AAA, including the AAA&#8217;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this agreement to arbitrate in this Section 10 (“Rules and Procedures”). The AAA&#8217;s rules, and a form for initiating arbitration proceedings, are available on the AAA&#8217;s site at http://www.adr.org. The language of any dispute resolution procedure or any proceedings will be English.</li>
<li>This Section 10 applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law. The disputes governed by these procedures in this Section 10 include without limitation (a) claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us; (b) claims that arose out of your use of the DR Commerce Solution; and (c) claims currently the subject of a purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class. However, the dispute resolution procedure specifically does not apply to (i) a claim relating to the enforcement or validity of your or our intellectual property rights; (ii) a claim relating to an allegation of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use; or (iii) claims for which class action litigation can be brought.</li>
<li><strong>YOU AND WE BOTH AGREE THAT (A) EACH OF US CAN ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND THERE SHALL BE NO AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS; (B) ARBITRATION CAN DECIDE ONLY YOUR AND/OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY&#8217;S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S); AND (C) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.</strong></li>
<li>If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, either you or we may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and us (subject to the arbitrator&#8217;s discretion to require an in-person hearing based on the circumstances). Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or us, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. Any in-person arbitration shall be held at a location determined by the AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and us.</li>
<li>You agree further that: (a) the arbitrator shall apply Minnesota law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, including principles of equity, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (b) the arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving us, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving both you and us to the extent required by applicable law; (c) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.</li>
<li>With the exception of Section 10.3 above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by the AAA, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, Section 10.3 above is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor we shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE </strong>Any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Minnesota, without regard to or application of its choice of law rules or conflicts-of-laws principles, except that the Arbitration provision of these Terms shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event that the Agreement to Arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and us must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Hennepin County, Minnesota, and both you and us agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Hennepin County, Minnesota for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.</li>
<li>GENERALThese Terms sets forth the entire understanding between you and us with respect to your use of the DR Commerce Solution and your purchase of Products and DR Services from us, and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous communications, agreements, and representations, whether written or oral, related thereto. No amendment to these Terms will be valid unless made in writing and signed by you and us. These Terms prevail over any other terms or conditions contained in or referred to elsewhere or implied by trade, custom or course of dealing. Any purported terms or conditions to the contrary are hereby excluded to the fullest extent legally permitted. DR may engage the services of subcontractors or agents to assist DR in the performance of its obligations related to these Terms. You may not assign or transfer your rights under these Terms, and any purported assignment or transfer shall be void. No relaxation, forbearance, delay or indulgence by either you or us in enforcing any of these Terms or the granting of time by either party to the other shall prejudice or restrict such rights and powers. No waiver of any term or condition of these Terms shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by us. The waiver of any breach of any Term shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or condition. If for any reason we determine or a court of competent jurisdiction finds that any provision or portion of these Terms to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid under applicable law in a particular jurisdiction: (a) these Terms will not be affected in other jurisdictions to the extent that such determination or finding has no application; and (b) in the relevant jurisdiction, the remainder of these Terms (to the fullest extent permitted by law) will continue in full force and effect. Neither you nor us shall be in breach of these Terms in the event that party is unable to perform its obligations as a result of any reason or condition beyond its reasonable control.</li>
