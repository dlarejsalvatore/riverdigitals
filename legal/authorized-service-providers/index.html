                                    <p>Authorized Service Provider (ASP) Terms</p>
<p>These Authorized Service Provider Terms (“Terms”), together with your Authorized Service Provider Registration Form (once approved by Pan Digital Network Limited), govern the collaborative business relationship between Pan Digital Network Limited (“DR”) and “you” (the organization on whose behalf you are agreeing to these Terms) to clarify how you and DR (each a “party” and collectively “us” or “we”) will work together to deliver an eCommerce, marketing or other business solution to clients. THESE TERMS WILL BECOME BINDING UPON BOTH OF US UPON DR’S APPROVAL OF YOUR SERVICE PROVIDER REGISTRATION FORM.</p>
<p>These Terms were last updated on December 16, 2020.</p>
<ol class="numbers">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Applicability.</span><br />
If you submit an Authorized Service Provider Registration Form (“Registration Form”) and it is accepted by DR, these Terms apply for each of us to support one another, collaborate and/or work as a team to deliver a business solution to a common client for whom we each have our own separate agreements and we each perform our own services for the common client. If agreed to separately in an Exhibit, Statement of Work or Business Plan, these Terms may also apply where one party acts as a direct subcontractor to the other with respect to one or more clients.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exhibits.</span><br />
Additional Exhibits to these Terms (each, an “Exhibit”), if identified in your accepted Registration Form, will be incorporated into these Terms and will apply to our collaboration. Any conflict between these Terms and an Exhibit will be governed by the terms in the Exhibit as it relates to the collaboration under that Exhibit.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statements of Work / Business Plan.</span><br />
Any additional specific business terms or details between us with respect to one or more common clients or projects (such as a party’s specific responsibilities, timing and payment, if any) must be mutually agreed to in a separate Statement of Work (each, an “SOW”) or a separate Business Plan (each, a “Business Plan”), as may be required by an applicable Exhibit, and will become part of these Terms. Any conflict between these Terms and an SOW or Business Plan, other than the indemnity obligations in Section 6, the ownership and intellectual property terms in Section 16, and the limitations on liability in Section 18, will be governed by the terms in the SOW or Business Plan as it relates to the service collaboration under that SOW.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Common goal and communication.</span><br />
We acknowledge and agree that we share a common goal to support one another to complete our individual scopes of work and minimize the program management effort required by the client. We will communicate in good faith outside the client-orchestrated meetings to ensure both common goals and individual goals are met.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Liaison.</span><br />
We will each appoint someone who will be responsible to serve as the liaison between us with respect to our collaboration. A party’s liaison will: (i) have day-to-day responsibility for supervising that party’s performance under the collaboration; and (ii) have responsibility for seeking all necessary approvals for any course of action, undertaking, obligation or responsibility in connection with that party’s performance under the collaboration. Each party’s liaisons will be appointed in your registration materials or an applicable SOW or Business Plan, and either party may change its liaison from time to time upon written notice to the other party.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We are each responsible for our own work.</span><br />
As between us, each of us is fully responsible for our own business, products, services, legal compliance and other responsibilities, including the obligations under our separate agreements with the client, and for our own work efforts, results, trademarks and other intellectual property. Each party agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the other party and its affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees harmless from and against any claim, and resulting costs, liabilities, losses, damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of any settlement agreed to by a party, (i) brought by a third party that its business, products or services violate any law, rule or regulation or any third party intellectual property rights, or (ii) for its fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence. To be indemnified, the party seeking indemnity must give the indemnifying party prompt written notice of the claim, reasonable assistance and sole authority to defend and settle the claim.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Standards for Training.</span><br />
To help promote a successful collaboration, DR requires its authorized service providers to be reasonably knowledgeable about and proficient with DR’s products and services as they relate to our collaboration. You agree to meet DR’s standards for training as required by DR’s Partner Program documentation that DR makes available from time to time.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-exclusive relationship; Independent Contractors.</span><br />
Our relationship is one of non-exclusive, independent contractors to one another. We can each work with other entities for similar or different work or projects. These Terms do not create any partnership, agency, joint venture or employer-employee relationship between us, and neither party may act on behalf of, or create any obligation on behalf of, the other party. Each party is responsible for its own employees, independent contractors and employment expenses and taxes.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Publicity and Marks.</span><br />
Except as may be set forth in an Exhibit, SOW, Business Plan or approved Registration Form, any press releases or publicity regarding our collaboration, or any other use of the other party’s name, trademarks or logos (“Marks”) in its client lists or otherwise will require the prior written consent of the other party (except if required by law or to comply with any legally required reporting obligations). If one or both of us are entitled under these Terms, an Exhibit, SOW, Business Plan or approved Registration Form to use the other party’s Marks or to promote the other’s products or services, upon notification of any incorrect usage of the Marks or improper promotion of the products or services, the notified party shall promptly correct such usage or promotion as directed.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Confidentiality.</span><br />
We each understand and agree that in the performance of these Terms, each party may have access to or may be exposed to, directly or indirectly, confidential information of the other party, including, but not limited to, trade secrets, contractual terms, customer information, marketing and business plans and technical information (“Confidential Information”). Each party agrees that: (a) all Confidential Information remains the exclusive property of the disclosing party, and the receiving party shall not use any Confidential Information for any purpose except in furtherance of these Terms; (b) it shall disclose Confidential Information only to those of its employees, contractors, agents and professional advisors who have a need to know such information in furtherance of these Terms (collectively, its “Representatives”); (c) it shall maintain (with at least the same degree of care it uses with its own Confidential Information), and shall use prudent methods to cause its Representatives to maintain, the confidentiality and secrecy of the Confidential Information; (d) it shall not, and it shall use prudent methods to ensure that its Representatives do not, copy, publish, disclose to others or use (other than pursuant to the terms hereof) the Confidential Information; and (e) it shall return or destroy all copies of Confidential Information upon request of the other party.Notwithstanding the above, Confidential Information shall not include any information to the extent it (a) is or becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission on the part of the receiving party, (b) is in the receiving party’s possession, without actual or constructive knowledge of an obligation of confidentiality with respect thereto, at or prior to the time of disclosure under these Terms, (c) is disclosed to the receiving party by a third party having no obligation of confidentiality with respect thereto, (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without reference to or use of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information, (e) is released from confidential treatment by written consent of the disclosing party, or (f) is required to be disclosed pursuant to law, court order, subpoena or governmental authority; provided that the receiving party promptly notifies the disclosing party and makes diligent efforts to limit such disclosure to that which is reasonably necessary.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Protection of Personal Data.</span><br />
We each agree to comply with all applicable data protection and data privacy laws, rules, and regulations as they apply to our respective handling, control of and/or processing of personal data (or similar defined terms under applicable laws). Such responsibilities include obligations (i) to maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards reasonably designed to prevent the unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal data, and (ii) to maintain and abide by a privacy policy which clearly describes how personal data will be collected, used, and disclosed, including without limitation all collection, use, and disclosure contemplated for the respective services provided to the client.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PCI Data Security / SOC Reports / Audit.</span><br />
If a party processes card volume, it shall hold a PCI Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) certification appropriate for the card volume it processes annually or, if PCI-DSS is superseded, a similar certification under the succeeding standard. Upon request of a party, the other party shall provide a copy of its then-current annual Attestation of Compliance. On an annual basis upon request of a party, the other party shall provide documentation or current audit results that pertain to the collaboration, which may include, as applicable to the collaboration, security and controls documentation/practices, and SOC 1 Type II and SOC 2 Type II reports (which will be the Confidential Information of the providing party). However, if a party does not provide the reasonably requested documentation, audit results or report, then upon reasonable notice, the other party may conduct a reasonable audit to determine such information.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Standards of Conduct.</span><br />
Each party will at all times conduct itself in a fair and professional manner, in accordance with the highest standards of the industry, and will not by way of any action, inaction, statement or omission, negatively impact the Marks, intellectual property rights, reputation or customer good will of the other party, as determined by the other party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any breach of these standards of conduct will constitute immediate grounds for termination and may result in irreparable harm requiring injunctive relief.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Representations, Warranties and Covenants.</span><br />
Each party represents, warrants and covenants to the other that: (i) it has full right, power and authority to enter into and fully perform its obligations under these Terms, including without limitation the right to bind any party it purports to bind to these Terms (and each person accepting these Terms represents and warrants that he or she is duly authorized and has legal capacity to execute and deliver these Terms on behalf of their organization); (ii) the execution, delivery and performance of these Terms by it does not conflict with any other agreement to which it is a party or by which it is bound; and (iii) it shall comply with all federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules and regulations applicable to its business and to the performance of its obligations in connection with these Terms.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-solicitation.</span><br />
While these Terms are in effect and for eighteen (18) calendar months thereafter, neither party shall directly or indirectly hire, offer to hire, entice away, solicit, or in any other way persuade or attempt to persuade any employee, officer, agent, or independent contractor of the other party to discontinue their relationship with that other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this does not prevent a party from hiring as an employee any person who responds to an advertisement for employment placed in the ordinary course of business by that party and/or who initiates contact with that party without any direct solicitation of that person by that party or any agent of that party. This provision is intended to apply only to the extent necessary to protect the parties against unfair competition. If the scope or enforceability of this provision is in any way disputed at any time, an arbitrator, court or other trier of fact may modify and enforce this provision to the extent it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ownership and Intellectual Property.</span><br />
Unless otherwise agreed in an Exhibit, each party retains all of its own rights to its respective Marks, intellectual property, products and services. Neither party shall claim any ownership in the other’s Marks, intellectual property, products or services, and all benefits and rights from the use of a party’s Marks shall inure to the owner of such Marks. The DR software and all modifications thereto and derivatives thereof shall be the sole property of DR.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Insurance.</span><br />
For so long as these Terms are in effect plus two years after, each of us agrees to maintain insurance coverage with reputable insurance carriers of at least: $1,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 in the aggregate for each of the following &#8211; commercial general liability, professional liability/errors and omissions with cyber risk and privacy coverage, and worker’s compensation with statutory limits. A party shall provide the other party with certificates of insurance upon request.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limitations on Liability.</span><br />
Except for any indemnification obligations in Section 6 or any payment obligations, the total liability a party may have towards the other under these Terms shall not exceed the amounts (if any) paid and/or to be paid to it under these Terms during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date on which the liability first arose. In no event shall either party be liable to the other for any indirect, special, consequential, reliance, punitive or incidental damages, including without limitation, loss or interruption of business, lost profits or revenue, or access limitations, delays, interruptions or disturbances to a party’s products or services or other similar pecuniary loss, however caused and whether based on contract, negligence, tort or other legal theory, regardless of whether advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy provided herein.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Term and Termination.</span><br />
Once you are accepted by DR as an authorized service provider, these Terms and any applicable Exhibits will remain in effect in perpetuity to allow for future collaborations, except that either party may terminate these Terms, any Exhibits or any applicable SOWs and/or Business Plans upon ten (10) days written notice of termination to the breaching party for material breach of these Terms and/or any affected Exhibits, SOWs or Business Plans (as applicable) if such material breach is not cured within such period. In addition, (a) if there are no active SOWs or Business Plans in place, then either party may terminate these Terms and/or any Exhibits upon sixty (60) days written notice of termination for convenience to the other party, and (b) you may terminate these Terms in accordance with Section 20. Upon the expiration or termination of these Terms or an Exhibit, SOW or Business Plan, each party shall discontinue their performance under the Terms and/or the terminated Exhibit(s), SOW(s) and Business Plan(s), as applicable, including all uses of the other’s Marks granted in connection with these Terms or the Exhibit(s), SOW(s) and Business Plan(s), as applicable, and shall, at its expense, promptly return or destroy all copies of the other party’s Confidential Information relating to the terminated Terms and/or Exhibit(s), SOW(s) and Business Plan(s), as applicable. The rights and obligations of Sections 6, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, this sentence of Section 19 and Sections 21 through 24 of these Terms, and any sections in any Exhibits that are intended to survive, shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms and/or the terminated Exhibit(s).</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Modifications.</span><br />
From time to time in the course of our business we may modify these Terms and Exhibits and/or our Services. We will provide at least thirty (30) days&#8217; advance notice via electronic posting or e-mail of any material change to these Terms, to the Exhibits or to the Services which we are collaborating on, unless applicable laws or regulatory requirements require us to give earlier notice. If the change materially impairs our relationship, you may terminate these Terms or the affected Exhibit(s), SOW(s) and Business Plan(s) by providing us thirty (30) days advance written notice of your election to terminate, provided that we receive your notice within thirty (30) days of our notice of the upcoming change. Subject to your termination rights in Section 19, your continued participation as an authorized service provider after the effective date of any modification to the Services or these Terms or Exhibits constitutes your acceptance of such modification.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notices.</span><br />
Notices sent to either party must be given in writing and will be deemed effective on the date of delivery: to you, at the most recent postal or e-mail address you provided to us in your registration information, or to us, at our corporate office identified on our website, attention General Counsel, when delivered by commercial carrier and evidenced by the delivery receipt.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Injunctive Relief.</span><br />
Each party acknowledges that its breach of these Terms would cause irreparable injury to the other party for which monetary damages might not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, a party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief and other equitable remedies in the event of a breach of these Terms and/or any Exhibit, SOW or Business Plan by the other party, without the necessity of posting a bond in connection therewith. The availability of injunctive relief shall be a cumulative, and not an exclusive, remedy available to a party. If a party breaches any of its covenants or obligations under these Terms and/or any Exhibit, SOW or Business Plan, that party agrees to pay all costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) incurred by the other party in enforcing any of the covenants or provisions of these Terms and/or the applicable Exhibit(s), SOW(s) and Business Plan(s).</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Governing Law.</span><br />
If DR’s U.S. entities are parties to these Terms or any Exhibit, SOW or Business Plan, disputes related thereto are governed by the laws of the State of New York, USA, without regard to any conflict of law provisions, and the parties expressly agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Hennepin County, Minnesota, USA for such disputes. If DR’s European entities but not its U.S. entities are parties to these Terms or any Exhibit, SOW or Business Plan, disputes related hereto are governed by the laws of the England and Wales, without regard to any conflict of law provisions, and the parties expressly agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in London, England for such disputes.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Miscellaneous.</span><br />
The approved Registration From, these Terms, and any Exhibit(s), SOW(s) and Business Plan(s) entered into pursuant to these Terms contain the entire agreement of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersede any previous and contemporaneous agreements and understandings with respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be amended or modified except by a writing signed by the parties hereto or by DR in accordance with Section 20. To the extent there is any conflict in the approved Registration Form and these Terms, the approved Registration From will control. No provisions in either party’s purchase orders, invoices or other business forms will alter these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is found to be legally unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible and any such unenforceability will not prevent enforcement of any other provision of these Terms. All provisions not affected by the invalidity shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision or breach of these Terms will be effective unless made in writing, nor will it be construed to be a continuing waiver of such provision or breach. The Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns. Neither party may assign these Terms or delegate its duties hereunder (whether in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise) without the express prior written consent of the other party, except that a party may assign these Terms without the prior written consent of the other party in connection with a merger or sale of all or substantially all of its assets or equity so long as it provides prompt written notice to the non-assigning party of the change, in which event the non-assigning party may terminate these Terms and any Exhibits, SOWs and Business Plans if the assignment is to a direct competitor of the non-assigning party. Any claim by you or DR for breach of these Terms must be brought within two (2) years of the date the party first learns of the breach or else the claim will be forever barred. No party will be in breach of these Terms if it is unable to perform its obligations (other than any payment obligations) due to conditions beyond its reasonable control, but if the condition remains in effect for more than thirty (30) calendar days (or if the condition causes, or a party believes in good faith it is likely to cause, a violation of applicable law, rule or regulation or a significant economic or liability risk), either party may terminate these Terms and/or the affected Exhibit(s), SOW(s) or Business Plan(s) without cause upon written notice to the other party.</li>

<p>If you are performing professional services to DR or DR’s clients under an approved Authorized Service Provider Registration Form, then this Exhibit applies to those professional services and this Exhibit is in addition to the Authorized Service Provider Terms. Capitalized terms used in this Exhibit have the same meaning as they do in the Terms.</p>
<ol class="numbers">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Performance of Professional Services.</span>
<ol class="numbers">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Statement of Work.</span> You will enter into a Statement of Work (a “SOW”) with either DR or DR’s client(s) pursuant to which you will perform certain professional services (the “Professional Services”). Where the SOW is entered into by you and DR’s client(s), you will coordinate the development of the SOW with DR. The mutually approved SOW is incorporated into this Exhibit by reference. You are solely responsible for determining the manner, method, time, and resources necessary to perform your Professional Services in accordance with the SOW and industry standards, and you must provide your own equipment, tools, and materials to perform your Professional Services, except as otherwise specified in the SOW.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Compliance with DR policies.</span> If you will access any DR facilities or use any DR Intellectual Property (as defined below) in connection with your performance of the Professional Services, then you acknowledge and agree to comply with any DR policies applicable to your access to the DR facilities or use of any DR Intellectual Property, as such policies may be updated from time to time.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Permitted Subcontractors.</span> You may not subcontract (or otherwise delegate) the performance of the Professional Services without first providing written notice to DR of your intent to subcontract, specifying to whom you intend to subcontract and for what purposes, and providing DR with ten (10) business days to review your notice. If DR does not object in writing to you (an e-mail response from DR to the sender of the notice is sufficient) by the end of its review period, then the subcontractor shall be deemed permitted for the purposes detailed in your notice. You may not subcontract to a person or entity to which DR has timely objected. You shall ensure that any permitted subcontractor is bound by a written non-disclosure agreement governing their access to and use of DR’s Confidential Information on terms no less restrictive than those set forth in Section 10 of the Terms. You are responsible for your permitted subcontractors’ performance and shall be liable for any of their breaches of the Terms, this Exhibit, and the SOW.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Resource Qualifications.</span> You shall assign to perform the Professional Services your employees and permitted subcontractors who have the qualifications and skills necessary to perform the Professional Services, and if any specific qualifications or skills are identified in the SOW, who also have those specific qualifications and skills. You shall also perform a reasonably diligent background check, at least in accordance with industry standards, on your employees and permitted subcontractors who will perform the Professional Services prior to their commencement of the Professional Services under the SOW. You agree you will notify DR of any employee or permitted subcontractor whose background check is not clear, and you shall not assign any such person to perform the Professional Services unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by DR. If DR reasonably believes any of your employees or permitted subcontractors assigned by you to perform the Professional Services will be unable to complete such services to DR’s reasonable satisfaction, then DR may, upon written or e-mail notice to you, request a replacement of such employee or permitted subcontractor, and upon receipt of such notice you shall promptly assign a replacement resource with substantially similar skills, qualifications and experience to perform the Professional Services at the same rate and or fee as previously agreed in the approved Registration Form or SOW, as applicable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acceptance of Professional Services.</span><br />
You agree that the Professional Services shall conform in all material respects to the specifications set forth in the applicable SOW and DR’s Guidelines and Best Practices, and you agree that DR’s obligation to pay for the Professional Services is subject to DR and/or DR’s client’s review and acceptance, such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld. DR or DR’s client and their authorized representatives may review, inspect, audit, and/or certify the Professional Services and resulting work product for such compliance, and you shall reasonably cooperate with such efforts. If DR or DR’s client reasonably believes the Professional Services have not been performed in accordance with the SOW and DR’s Guidelines and Best Practices, DR will inform you, and you shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly re-perform the Professional Services, at no additional cost to DR, in accordance with DR’s instructions and to DR’s sole and reasonable satisfaction.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">License Rights.</span>
<ol class="numbers">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Definition of Intellectual Property.</span> For purposes of this Exhibit, a party’s “Intellectual Property” means any of its inventions, discoveries, ideas, technology, computer programs, application programming interfaces, templates, formulas, algorithms, source code, techniques, know-how, data, writings, content, documents, designs, methods, platforms, applets, HTML, web pages, procedures, service marks, equipment, merchandise, images, or any of its other patents, trade secrets, or intellectual property or any and all improvements, modifications, derivatives, or components thereof.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">License to DR’s Intellectual Property.</span> If you require any rights to any of DR’s Intellectual Property in connection with the performance of the Professional Services, then subject to the Terms and this Exhibit and during the Exhibit or SOW Term, as applicable, DR grants to you and your permitted subcontractors a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, license to DR’s Intellectual Property provided to you by DR for your performance of the Professional Services, and only for the sole and exclusive purpose of performing the Professional Services under the SOW. Except for this limited license to DR’s Intellectual Property, you acquire no rights in or to DR’s Intellectual Property and you acknowledge that all right, title and interest in and to DR’s Intellectual Property, whether conceived, developed, acquired, or otherwise obtained prior to or following the Effective Date of this Exhibit or the SOW, shall remain with DR. If a user ID and password is required to access or use DR’s Intellectual Property, you shall be solely responsible for the security and use thereof and shall immediately notify DR in writing if the security of the user ID and/or password is compromised. You shall notify DR in writing within two business days if an individual to whom a user ID has been assigned no longer requires rights to DR’s Intellectual Property, such as, for example, an individual who ceases to be your employee or who is otherwise no longer involved in the performance of the Professional Services.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">License to Your Intellectual Property.</span> If DR or DR’s clients require any rights to any of your Intellectual Property in connection with DR’s or DR’s client’s receipt of the Professional Services, then subject to the Terms and this Exhibit and during the Exhibit or SOW Term, you grant to DR and DR’s client a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, license to your Intellectual Property as may be necessary for DR or DR’s client(s) to receive the Professional Services under the SOW. Except for this limited license to your Intellectual Property, this Exhibit does not grant to DR or to DR’s client, and DR and DR’s client do not acquire, any rights under this Exhibit in or to your Intellectual Property. DR acknowledges that, as between you and DR, all right, title and interest in and to your Intellectual Property, whether conceived, developed, acquired, or otherwise obtained prior to or following the Effective Date of this Exhibit or the SOW, shall remain with you. In no event shall you install on DR’s computers or systems any software program or data belonging to any third party, or utilize any materials or information belonging to any third party in the performance of the Professional Services, without such third party’s express prior written consent and a right to provide DR and DR’s client the license rights specified in this Section. Notwithstanding the above and for purpose of clarification, if you are developing intellectual property for DR, then the terms of the Intellectual Property Development Exhibit (and not this Section 3.3) apply to such development.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use of the Intellectual Property.</span> In connection with the license rights granted above, neither party shall: (a) decompile, copy, disassemble, modify, decrypt, translate, extract or otherwise reverse engineer any licensed Intellectual Property of the other party; (b) license, sublicense, sell, resell, transfer, assign, distribute any licensed Intellectual Property of the other party or otherwise commercially exploit or make the licensed Intellectual Property of the other party available to any third party (except that DR may make your Intellectual Property available to DR’s client(s), as applicable); (c) modify or make derivative works based upon the licensed Intellectual Property of the other party; (d) create Internet &#8220;links&#8221; or &#8220;frame&#8221; or &#8220;mirror&#8221; the licensed Intellectual Property of the other party on any other server or wireless or Internet-based device; (e) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the licensed Intellectual Property of the other party or the data contained therein; or (f) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the licensed Intellectual Property of the other party or its related systems or networks.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Work Product.</span> You agree that you will not incorporate or permit to be incorporated any of DR’s Intellectual Property into any of your Intellectual Property, or to the outputs, reports, products, or services created in the performance of the Professional Services hereunder (“Work Product”), without DR’s express prior written consent. You further agree that you shall be solely responsible for the support and maintenance of any Work Product created in the performance of the Professional Services hereunder, and that DR does not guarantee that any changes or updates to DR’s Intellectual Property will be compatible with or conform with any Work Product and you shall be liable for any costs associated with any updates or changes to the Work Product as a result of DR’s changes or updates to DR’s Intellectual Property.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOW Term.</span><br />
The term of a SOW shall be as set forth in the SOW, and shall remain in effect for such term unless terminated earlier in accordance with the Terms.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fees, Payment Terms and Audit Rights.</span>
<ol class="numbers">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Invoicing.</span> You shall provide the Professional Services at the fees set forth in the applicable SOW. Where the SOW is entered into with DR, you must submit your invoices to DR for Professional Services monthly, unless otherwise expressly agreed in the SOW, and DR shall pay an undisputed invoice within forty-five (45) days of DR’s receipt of the invoice. You agree that each invoice submitted to DR must have a purchase order number (“PO Number”) received from DR and that DR will reject any invoice that does not contain a PO Number. Invoices shall be sent to Pan Digital Network Limited, Inc. Attn: Accounts Payable, 10380 Bren Road West, Minnetonka, MN 55343 and must reference the DR liaison listed in the SOW, or if none is listed, the DR liaison listed in the approved Registration Form.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reimbursable Expenses.</span> If a SOW expressly permits reimbursement of expenses by DR incurred in connection with that SOW, you will be reimbursed for those reasonable expenses as described in the SOW that you incurred in connection with the performance of the Professional Services under the SOW that were pre-approved in writing, including by email, by DR, provided you submit documentation of such expenses as DR may reasonably require. Any reimbursable air travel to be performed by you shall be coach-class only.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proportional Service Fees.</span> Upon the termination of the Terms, this Exhibit or any SOW for any reason other than termination by DR for your uncured breach, you will be paid fees and expenses on a proportional basis as stated in the applicable SOW for work actually performed up to and including the effective date of such termination.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional Representations, Warranties and Covenants.</span>
<ol class="numbers">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your Representations, Warranties, and Covenants.</span> In addition to the representations, warranties, and covenants in the Terms, you represent, warrant, and covenant that: (a) your Intellectual Property is original to you or that you have secured the rights for DR and/or DR’s client(s) to use your Intellectual Property; (b) your Intellectual Property does not infringe on any patent, trademark, mark rights, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property or proprietary rights of any third party; (c) you shall not access or use any personally identifiably information collected by DR or DR’s client in connection with the performance of the Professional Services hereunder; and (d) your Intellectual Property does not contain any viruses or other harmful components.</li>

<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Compliance with Pan Digital Network Limited policies.</span><br />
If you will access any Pan Digital Network Limited facilities or use any of Pan Digital Network Limited’s intellectual property in connection with the performance of the Services hereunder, then you acknowledge and agree to comply with any Pan Digital Network Limited policies applicable to your access to the Pan Digital Network Limited facilities or use of Pan Digital Network Limited’s intellectual property, as such policies may be updated from time to time.

<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">License Rights.</span><br />
If you require any rights to any of Pan Digital Network Limited’s intellectual property in connection with the performance of your Services under this Exhibit, then subject to the Terms and this Exhibit and during the Exhibit or SOW Term, as applicable, Pan Digital Network Limited grants to you and your permitted subcontractors a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, license to Pan Digital Network Limited’s intellectual property provided to you by Pan Digital Network Limited for your performance of the Services, and only for the sole and exclusive purpose of performing the Services under the SOW.

Except where the context requires otherwise, references in these Data Handling Standards for Authorized Service Providers to the Agreement are to the Agreement as amended by, and including, these Data Handling Standards for Authorized Service Providers.</p>
<ol class="numbers">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background and Purpose</span>. Each party is responsible for complying with any privacy, data security, and Data Protection Legislation that may apply to the handling of Personal Data under the Agreement. These Data Handling Standards for Authorized Service Providers were created to allow Pan Digital Network Limited to have an open data sharing arrangement with you. The purpose is to ensure that any transfers of Personal Data between the parties are completed using appropriate safeguards and that each party understands its obligations under Data Protection Legislation. These Data Handling Standards for Authorized Service Providers lay out the obligations of each party, including our respective responsibilities under Data Protection Legislation.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Obligations of the Parties</span>. Each party is responsible for ensuring that it processes Personal Data correctly under Data Protection Legislation. Pan Digital Network Limited is the Data Controller of the Personal Data. You are Pan Digital Network Limited’s Data Processor (or Service Provider as defined by the CCPA) of the Personal Data. In that capacity, you shall process the Personal Data only for the limited and specified purposes set out in the Agreement, and in compliance with Pan Digital Network Limited’s documented, lawful instructions.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description of Personal Data and Purpose of Processing. </span>Distributor will process, on behalf of Pan Digital Network Limited, the Personal Data of those purchasers that purchase a title, license right, and/or usage right to a product using Pan Digital Network Limited Services (“Shopper”) that are protected under Data Protection Legislation. The categories of Personal Data that you process may include, but are not limited to, names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and other related transaction information. The Personal Data will be processed for the following purposes:
<ul>
<li>To ensure performance of the Distributor’s obligations as a Processor under the Agreement,</li>
<li>To share the data with third parties and service providers and use Sub-processors for carrying out specific processing activities in a manner consistent with Sections 9(d) and (e) of these Data Handling Standards for Authorized Service Providers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Policies.</span> For the avoidance of doubt, Pan Digital Network Limited’s privacy policy will govern how Pan Digital Network Limited will collect and process Personal Data as well as how Pan Digital Network Limited will hold its third parties, service providers, and processors accountable for processing on its behalf. Pan Digital Network Limited is responsible for fulfilling promises as outlined in its privacy policy, and Distributor is responsible for fulfilling its obligations under these Data Handling Standards for Authorized Service Providers.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Security of Personal Data.</span> You agree to take reasonable steps to provide a level of security appropriate to the sensitivity of the information in your control. You represent, warrant and covenant to us that you have implemented technical and organizational security measures, which meet industry best practices and comply with all applicable Data Protection Legislation, to prevent any unauthorized access, use or disclosure of Personal Data, and your processing of Personal Data shall at all times be performed in accordance with such technical and organizational security measures.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Security Breach.</span> You will immediately notify Pan Digital Network Limited in accordance with applicable law about any actual or reasonably suspected accidental or unauthorized access, loss, use, acquisition, disclosure or Processing of Personal Data (a “Security Breach”). With respect to any Security Breach, you will take all steps reasonably necessary to investigate and remediate the effects of such occurrence, to mitigate any harm to those individuals that are affected or could be affected by such occurrence, prevent the re-occurrence, and comply with applicable law.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remediation or Security Audit.</span> You agree to abide by any and all security guidelines, policies and requirements that Pan Digital Network Limited provides to you from time to time (collectively, the “Security Requirements”). Pan Digital Network Limited reserves the right to require remediation of any security report qualifications or perform an audit of your security controls. Any audit of your security controls shall be performed upon fourteen (14) calendar days prior written notice to you. Pan Digital Network Limited may also make such an audit a precondition of entering into any transaction(s) with you under these Data Handling Standards for Authorized Service Providers. The parties agree to discuss in good faith any issues identified by us in connection with any such audit, including without limitation remediation efforts in such regard; provided however the costs associated with any changes to your infrastructure effectuated by you as a result of such audit will be borne solely by you. You represent and warrant that you have in place a business continuity and disaster recovery plan in writing and shall provide such plan to Pan Digital Network Limited upon written request.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Transfers of Personal Data Outside of the EEA.</span> You shall not transfer Personal Data to a territory outside of the EEA or the United Kingdom unless you have taken such measures as are necessary to ensure the transfer is in compliance with applicable law. The parties acknowledge that adequate protection for the Personal Data must exist for any transfer and will, if needed, enter into an appropriate agreement governing such transfer of Personal Data, including, but not limited to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, taking into account the level of protection of the third country and taking additional steps to guarantee protection if necessary, unless another appropriate safeguard for the transfer exists.To the extent that that this Agreement involves the transfer of the Personal Data outside of the EEA or United Kingdom, the parties agree the Standard Contractual Clauses including its Appendices 1 and 2 shall be incorporated into the Agreement. To that end, the Standard Contractual Clauses, including Appendix 1 (which is attached at the end of these Data Handling Standards for Authorized Service Providers) and Appendix 2 (the details of which are included in the Privacy Details in the Distributor Registration Form) shall constitute the completed Standard Contractual Clauses. Where and to the extent that the Standard Contractual Clauses apply pursuant to this Clause, if there is any conflict between these Data Handling Standards for Authorized Service Providers and the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail.</li>
