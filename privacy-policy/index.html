                standard methods to protect that information as required by applicable laws. Although we use reasonable
                measures to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of information provided over the
                Internet or stored in our databases. You are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect

                signing off when finished using a shared computer or mobile device. We leverage industry best practices
                to mitigate potential compromises. If the Personal Data under the custody of Pan Digital Network Limited is (or is
                likely to be) divulged, damaged or lost, we will immediately take remedial measures, inform the users in

                and alter the content accordingly. We may also use that users’ geographic location and company data. In
                some circumstances, for account-based marketing, this could include “likes” that we find in the public
                domain. </p>
            <p>Also, we rely on fraud monitoring to help us reduce the need to manually review orders for fraud. We
