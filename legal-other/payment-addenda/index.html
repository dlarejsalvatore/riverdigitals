                                    <p>These ELV Support Standards are in addition to the terms in the Agreement. Capitalized terms used in these Standards have the same meaning as they do in the Agreement.</p>
<ol>
<li><u>ELV Support</u>. The parties will by use of the Order Form agree on those countries in which we shall accept payment by shoppers using the “Elektronisches Lastschriftverfahren” or any other agreed direct debit payment method (“<strong>ELV</strong>”). We shall configure our Solution to accept payment via ELV from shoppers purchasing Products through each such ELV enabled country in a Transaction (each, an “<strong>ELV Transaction</strong>”).  Within the Order Form, you shall select one of the following two (2) fulfillment options for ELV Transactions by checking the appropriate box below (if no box is checked, you shall be deemed to have checked the delayed fulfillment option):</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(i) We shall implement real-time fulfillment of Products ordered by a shopper through an ELV Transaction.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(ii) We shall implement a seven (7) business day delay on the fulfillment of Products ordered by a shopper through an ELV Transaction.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><u>ELV Payment Reversals.</u> You agree and acknowledge that payments by ELV are subject to two (2) forms of payment reversals (collectively, “<strong>ELV Payment Reversals</strong>”): (a) a payment rejection initiated by a bank involved in the ELV payment (a “<strong>Bank-Initiated Payment Rejection</strong>”), and (b) a payment reversal initiated directly by the shopper (an “<strong>Shopper-Initiated Bank Payment Reversal</strong>”). You further acknowledge that the operating rules of banks accepting ELV payments, and the laws, rules and regulations applicable to ELV payments, shoppers and banks may have a right to cause an ELV Payment Reversal without any reason for an extended period of time following the date of the ELV Transaction (which period may be longer than the returns period applicable to the ELV enabled country), thereby increasing the risk of fraud and payment reversals for transactions on which ELV is used as a payment method.  You further acknowledge that use of real-time fulfillment for ELV Transactions further increases the risk of fraud and payment reversals.  For the avoidance of doubt, a refund paid by us to a shopper who contacts our customer service directly to effectuate a return in accordance with the return policy for a Product shall not be considered either a Shopper-Initiated Bank Payment Reversal or a Bank-Initiated Payment Rejection.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">For the avoidance of doubt, each Product subject to an ELV Payment Reversal shall be treated by both of us as an order-level satisfaction refund validly provided by us.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, we shall bear no liability or risk in connection with, and you shall be solely responsible for all liability and risk in connection with, any payment reversals and fraud in connection with ELV Transactions, including without limitation for Bank-Initiated Payment Rejections and Shopper-Initiated Bank Payment Reversals.  We shall have the right to offset the entire amount of any ELV Payment Reversals received by us against amounts payable by us to you under the Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, we shall be entitled to retain our fees on each Products subject to an ELV Payment Reversal).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">You shall be solely responsible for reversing any shoppers’ license key entitlements or other usage rights to a Product resulting from an ELV Payment Reversal.</p>
